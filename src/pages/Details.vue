              <p>
                The discovery phase is an essential part of my design process where I delve into every aspect of the product <strong class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200 font-medium">to gain a comprehensive understanding</strong>. It involves conducting extensive research and analysis to gather insights that lay the groundwork for the entire design journey.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this phase, I explore various elements such as the competition, market dynamics, and current challenges to inform my design decisions. Here's what the discovery phase typically includes:
              </p>
              <ul class="space-y-4">
                <li class="flex items-center before:mr-3 before:content-['âœ´ï¸Ž']">These objectives are derived from user insights, align with the client's goals, and provide solutions to the identified challenges.</li>
                <li class="flex items-center before:mr-3 before:content-['âœ´ï¸Ž']">These objectives are derived from user insights, align with the client's goals, and provide solutions to the identified challenges.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                First and foremost, I immerse myself in understanding my client's vision and project goals. By closely collaborating with the client, <strong class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200 font-medium">I ensure a clear understanding of their requirements and expectations for the product</strong>. This sets the foundation for the design process ðŸ‘‡
              </p>

                <img class="dark:hidden" :src="DetailsImageLight" width="628" height="253" alt="Post details light">
                <img class="hidden dark:block" :src="DetailsImageDark" width="628" height="253" alt="Post details dark">

              </figure>
              <p>
                By conducting a thorough discovery phase, I establish a solid foundation for the subsequent stages of the design process. <strong class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200 font-medium">This phase equips me with the necessary knowledge</strong> about the product's context, market landscape, user needs, and design objectives.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this understanding, I can move forward confidently into the ideation, concept development, and prototyping phases, knowing that my designs are rooted in a deep understanding of the product and its users.
